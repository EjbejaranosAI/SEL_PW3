## Some CBR description
 
A CBR planning/design/configuration prototype system should be developed in a team-group of four people. The domain could be chosen by the team, upon agreement with the professor. It could be oriented to a design or configuration or temporal planning domain (cooking recipes, cocktail preparation, robot planner, travel planner, architectural design, etc.).


In artificial intelligence and philosophy[verification needed], case-based reasoning (CBR), broadly construed, is the process of solving new problems based on the solutions of similar past problems.
